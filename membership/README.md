# Apereo Foundation Membership

The  Apereo Foundation is a New Jersey non-stock, non-profit corporation, with
members drawn from higher education on four continents. It’s mission? To help
educational organizations deliver their mission, by developing and sustaining
open source software. Open source software provides educational institutions
with choices in a marketplace otherwise dominated by commercial proprietary
vendors. It plays a major role in keeping the market honest, and fostering
innovation.

By becoming an Apereo Foundation member, you –

+ Ensure support for software you rely on. Your membership dues work to ensure
  effective licensing, IPR management practices, infrastructure support,
  community coordination, outreach, and more.
+ Give your institution a say in the way Apereo is run, and how it sets
  priorities. Your institution has a vote in elections for the Apereo Foundation
  Board, which provides strategic leadership for the foundation.
+ Are able to access programs such as the Apereo Incubation Program. Have a
  software project you believe meets a higher education need? Apereo is the
  place to find partners and learn from others who've grown communities to
  sustain software.
+ Become part of a community of peers - a global network of educational
  institutions working together to address common issues and solve common
  problems - with many opportunities to participate.
