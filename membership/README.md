# Apereo Foundation Membership

The Apereo Foundation is a New Jersey non-stock, non-profit corporation, with
members drawn from higher education on four continents. Its mission? To help
educational organizations deliver their mission by developing and sustaining
open source software. Open source software provides educational institutions
with choices in a marketplace otherwise dominated by proprietary
software products. It plays a major role in keeping the market honest and
fostering innovation.

By becoming an Apereo Foundation member, you –

- Ensure support for software you rely on. Your membership dues work to ensure
  effective licensing, IPR management practices, infrastructure support,
  community coordination, outreach, and more.
- Give your institution a say in the way Apereo is run, and how it sets
  priorities. Your institution has a vote in elections for the Apereo Foundation
  Board, which provides strategic leadership for the foundation.
- Are able to access programs such as the Apereo Incubation Program. Have a
  software project you believe meets a higher education need? Apereo is the
  place to find partners and learn from others who've grown communities to
  sustain software.
- Become part of a community of peers - a global network of educational
  institutions working together to address common issues and solve common
  problems - with many opportunities to participate.

## Organizational Membership Dues

Apereo membership consists of two elements. The first is a Core Foundation
Subscription paid by all members. This covers key services Apereo provides for
all its software communities – technical infrastructure, legal and licensing
support, community coordination, events, and outreach. The second is a
Supporting Subscription for specific Apereo Projects. For example, the Sakai
Supporting Subscription pays for Sakai-specific funded efforts, infrastructure,
travel, and events.

The dues levels set by the Apereo Board for 2018 for educational organizations
are as follows.

Core Foundation Dues and Sakai Supporting Subscription dues vary by the annual
budget of the member institution.

CAS and Bedework Supporting Subscription dues are a fixed price regardless of
member institution budget.

uPortal Supporting Subscription is offered at several levels not tied to
member institution budget.
