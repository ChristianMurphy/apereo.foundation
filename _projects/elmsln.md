title: ELMS Learning Network
description: ELMS Learning Network (ELMSLN) is an open source educational technology platform for building and sustaining innovation in course technologies. It is a Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) that utilizes a Suite of Tools approach to system design and deployment. We believe it takes an ecosystem to effectively meet the needs of educators and believe in empowering faculty by treating courses as small networked ecosystems that encourage experimentation, fragmentation, growth, and then ultimately stabilization of new ideas.
