# Audit committee

The Apereo bylaws require a standing audit committee.

> The Board shall annually determine the membership of two (2) Standing
> Committees: ... A Remuneration Committee ... \[and] An Audit Committee, the
> role of which is to oversee or conduct an annual audit of Foundation finances.
> (VIII.1.B)

## Audit committee membership

TODO: Acknowledge who serves on this committee. Since when? Terms expire when?
In what roles? Does this committee have a chair, etc.?

## Reports and deliverables

TODO: Add or link reports and deliverables. Annual audits produced by or
overseen by the committee. Other reports and public documents.

+ Apereo annual reports include a brief unaudited financial summary
+ Apereo 990s are available via public sites such as

TODO: Hyperlink annual reports when they are available on this site.
TODO: Hyperlink 990s if and when they're available on this site (some of
Apereo's older 990s assert that Apereo will make a copy of the 990 available
on its website, so Apereo may be obligated to do this. More recent 990s don't
check this box, but it still seems a best practice in the interest of
transparency and openness).

## Meetings and minutes

TODO: Are dates of past and future meetings available?
TODO: Are these open meetings? Could anyone join? How?
TODO: Are minutes of past meetings available?

## Previous committee members

TODO: Who should be thanked for past service on this committee? With what dates
of service?
